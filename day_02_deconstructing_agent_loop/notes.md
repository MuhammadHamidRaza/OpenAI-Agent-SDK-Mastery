# Day 2: Deconstructing the Agent Loop & Sessions

## Key Concepts:

- Agent Loop: The core cycle of an agent (Perceive, Reason, Act).
- Sessions: Managing conversation history and memory.
- Runner: Different ways to execute agents (sync, async, streamed).

## Examples:

Refer to the `example/` directory for code examples demonstrating these concepts.

## Notes / Tips:

- Focus on understanding the flow of the agent loop.
- Experiment with different `Runner` methods.
- Explore how sessions maintain context across turns.
