# Day 11: Project 1: Simple Q&A Agent

## Key Concepts:

*   Building a complete Q&A agent from scratch.
*   Integrating a hosted tool (`WebSearchTool`) with an agent.
*   Implementing conversational memory using `SQLiteSession`.
*   Running and testing a multi-turn conversation with an agent.
*   Inspecting the agent's execution flow using `RunResult`.

## Examples:

Refer to the `example/` directory for the complete code of the Simple Q&A Agent.

## Notes / Tips:

*   This project combines concepts from previous days, including agents, tools, sessions, and runners.
*   Ensure your API keys are set up correctly, especially if you are using the `WebSearchTool`.
*   Inspecting the `RunResult` is a powerful way to debug and understand your agent's behavior.
