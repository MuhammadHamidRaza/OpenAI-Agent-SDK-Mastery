# Day 3: Runner and Basic Execution

## Key Concepts:

- Understanding the Runner and its role in agent execution.
- Different execution modes: sync, async, and streaming.
- Inspecting `RunResult` and `RunResultStreaming`.

## Examples:

Refer to the `example/` directory for code examples demonstrating these concepts.

## Notes / Tips:

- Pay attention to the differences between `run()`, `run_sync()`, and `run_streamed()`.
- Understand when to use each method based on your application's needs.
- Practice inspecting the `RunResult` objects to debug and understand agent behavior.
