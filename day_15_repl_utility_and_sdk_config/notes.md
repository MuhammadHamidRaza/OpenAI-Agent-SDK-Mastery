# Day 15: REPL Utility and SDK Configuration

## Key Concepts:

*   **REPL Utility (run_demo_loop):** Interactive testing of agents in the terminal.
*   **SDK Configuration:** Fine-tuning model behavior, temperature, max turns, timeouts, and runtime settings.
*   **Fast Iteration:** Rapidly test prompts, tools, and instructions.
*   **Debugging:** Inspect RunResult, traces, tool calls, and outputs in real time.
*   **Safe Experimentation:** Test guardrails, sessions, and handoffs in a controlled environment.

## Examples:

*   This day focuses on practical usage and examples of REPL utility and SDK configuration.

## Notes / Tips:

*   REPL and SDK configuration are crucial for efficient agent development.
*   Use REPL for quick testing and debugging.
*   Understand SDK configuration to control agent behavior and optimize performance.
