## Examples:

*   This day focuses on theoretical understanding and conceptual examples; specific implementation details are covered in later days.

## Notes / Tips:

*   Guardrails are essential for responsible AI development and deployment.
*   Think about potential risks and how guardrails can mitigate them.
*   Consider the different stages where guardrails can be applied (input, output, behavior).
