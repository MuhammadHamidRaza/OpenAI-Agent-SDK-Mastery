### **Course Overview**

Welcome to Day 30 of the **OpenAI Agent SDK Mastery** course! You've learned about short-term (session) and long-term (vector store/RAG) memory. Today, we delve into **Advanced Memory Optimization** techniques. As agents handle more complex tasks and longer conversations, efficiently managing their memory becomes crucial for performance, cost-effectiveness, and maintaining context. This session will explore strategies like summarization, compression, filtering, and hybrid memory architectures to ensure your agents can leverage vast amounts of information without being overwhelmed or incurring excessive costs. By the end of today, you'll be equipped to design highly optimized memory systems for your AI agents.

## The Challenges of Growing Agent Memory

While memory is essential, simply adding more data to an agent's context or knowledge base can lead to new challenges:

*   **Context Window Limits:** LLMs have a finite context window. Feeding too much raw information can lead to truncation or the model "forgetting" earlier parts of the conversation.
*   **Increased Latency:** Longer prompts (due to more context) take longer for LLMs to process, increasing response times.
*   **Higher Costs:** LLM API calls are often priced per token. More context means more tokens, leading to higher operational costs.
*   **Information Overload:** Even if the LLM can handle a large context, too much irrelevant information can dilute its focus and lead to less accurate responses.
*   **Scalability:** Managing and querying massive long-term memory stores efficiently.

Advanced memory optimization techniques aim to address these challenges by making memory smarter, not just bigger.

## Advanced Memory Optimization Techniques

### 1. Context Summarization

*   **Concept:** Instead of passing the entire raw conversation history or retrieved documents to the LLM, summarize them into a concise representation. This reduces token count while retaining key information.
*   **How it works:** An LLM (or a smaller, specialized model) is used to generate a summary of past turns or retrieved documents. This summary is then included in the prompt for the current turn.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces token usage, fits more history into the context window, potentially improves LLM focus.
*   **Considerations:** Summarization can lose fine-grained details. Balance conciseness with information retention.

### 2. Context Compression (e.g., using Embeddings)

*   **Concept:** Beyond summarization, techniques that compress the semantic meaning of information into a denser representation.
*   **How it works:** Instead of passing full text, pass embeddings of past interactions or documents. The LLM might then be prompted to use these embeddings to guide its response, or a separate retrieval step uses them.
*   **Benefits:** Extremely efficient for memory storage and retrieval, especially for long-term memory.
*   **Considerations:** Requires sophisticated handling by the LLM or additional retrieval steps.

### 3. Filtering and Relevance Ranking

*   **Concept:** Only include the most relevant pieces of information in the LLM's context.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Semantic Search (RAG):** As discussed on Day 29, retrieve only the top-K most relevant document chunks from a vector store.
    *   **Conversation Filtering:** For long conversations, filter out irrelevant turns or focus on turns related to the current topic.
    *   **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combine keyword search with semantic search for more precise retrieval.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces noise, improves LLM focus, lowers token count.
*   **Considerations:** Requires accurate relevance scoring to avoid missing critical information.

### 4. Hybrid Memory Architectures

*   **Concept:** Combine different types of memory (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic) and retrieval strategies to leverage their respective strengths.
*   **How it works:** An agent might use a short-term session for immediate conversation, a vector store for factual knowledge, and a graph database for complex relationships, with an orchestrator deciding which memory to query.
*   **Benefits:** Comprehensive knowledge access, optimized for different types of information, highly flexible.
*   **Considerations:** Increased architectural complexity.

### 5. Episodic Memory (Conceptual)

*   **Concept:** Storing specific events or experiences the agent has had, often associated with metadata (e.g., time, location, emotional valence).
*   **How it works:** When an important event occurs (e.g., a user preference is stated, a tool call is made), it's recorded as an "episode" and stored. Later, the agent can retrieve relevant episodes.
*   **Benefits:** Enables agents to recall specific past interactions, learn from experiences, and build a personal history.

## Example: Conceptual Summarization of Conversation History

Let's illustrate how summarization could work to keep the context window manageable for a long conversation. We'll simulate a conversation and then summarize it.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession
import os

# Ensure API key is set
if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    print("Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")
    exit()

# Agent for summarization
summarizer_agent = Agent(
    name="Summarizer",
    instructions="You are an expert summarizer. Condense the provided conversation history into a concise summary, retaining all key information and decisions."
)

# Agent for conversation
chat_agent = Agent(
    name="ChatAssistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful chat assistant. Keep responses brief."
)

def get_conversation_summary(session_id: str, db_path: str = "chat_history.db") -> str:
    """Retrieves conversation history from a session and summarizes it."
    session = SQLiteSession(session_id, db_path)
    all_items = session.get_items() # Get all items from the session
    """
    # Extract messages for summarization
    conversation_text = ""
    for item in all_items:
        if hasattr(item, 'text'):
            conversation_text += f"{item.text}\n"

    if not conversation_text.strip():
        return "No conversation history to summarize."

    print("\n--- Summarizing Conversation History ---")
    summary_result = Runner.run_sync(summarizer_agent, f"Summarize the following conversation:\n\n{conversation_text}")
    return summary_result.final_output

# Simulate a long conversation
session_id = "user_123_long_chat"
long_session = SQLiteSession(session_id, "chat_history.db")
long_session.clear_session() # Start fresh

print("--- Simulating Long Conversation ---")
Runner.run_sync(chat_agent, "Hi, I need help with my order.", session=long_session)
Runner.run_sync(chat_agent, "My order number is #12345. It hasn\'t arrived yet.", session=long_session)
Runner.run_sync(chat_agent, "It was placed on October 26th.", session=long_session)
Runner.run_sync(chat_agent, "Can you check the status?", session=long_session)

# Get and print summary
summary = get_conversation_summary(session_id, "chat_history.db")
print(f"\nSummarized Conversation: {summary}")

# Now, use the summary in a new turn to save tokens
print("\n--- Continuing conversation with summary ---")
new_prompt = f"Based on the previous conversation summary: {summary}\nWhat is the next step for order #12345?"
result = Runner.run_sync(chat_agent, new_prompt, session=long_session)
print(f"Agent's response with summary context: {result.final_output}")

```

**Explanation:**

*   We use a `summarizer_agent` to condense the `SQLiteSession` history.
*   The `get_conversation_summary` function retrieves all messages and sends them to the `summarizer_agent`.
*   The resulting summary can then be used in subsequent prompts to the main `chat_agent`, reducing the number of tokens sent to the LLM while retaining the core context.
