# Day 6: Integrating Basic Tools

## Key Concepts:

- How to integrate custom tools with an agent using the `tools` parameter.
- The agent's decision-making process for using tools.
- Examples of agents using `add_numbers` and `greet_user` tools.

## Examples:

Refer to the `example/` directory for code examples demonstrating these concepts.

## Notes / Tips:

- Ensure the tools are properly defined (from Day 5).
- Observe how the agent dynamically selects and uses the tools based on the prompt.
- This is a crucial step in making agents perform real-world actions.
