# Day 12: Intro to Multi-Agent Systems

## Key Concepts:

*   **Limitations of Single Agents:** Why complex problems require more than one agent.
*   **Power of Multi-Agent Systems:** Specialization, modularity, scalability, robustness, improved performance, mimicking human collaboration.
*   **Use Cases:** Automated research, customer support, software development, complex planning.
*   **Handoffs:** Conceptual mechanism for agents to collaborate by delegating tasks.

## Examples:

*   This day focuses on theoretical understanding; no specific code examples are provided in the `README.md`.

## Notes / Tips:

*   Think about how real-world teams collaborate and how that can be applied to AI agents.
*   Consider how breaking down a problem into smaller, specialized tasks can improve overall system design.
*   The concept of "Handoffs" is crucial for enabling communication and task delegation between agents.
