### **Course Overview**

Welcome to Day 43 of the **OpenAI Agent SDK Mastery** course! You've built, optimized, and deployed agents, and learned how to manage their releases. Today, we focus on empowering you to continue your learning and problem-solving independently by mastering the **API Reference and exploring Extensions**. The official API documentation is your most valuable resource for understanding every class, function, and parameter within the SDK. Additionally, we'll discuss how to discover and leverage extensions or integrate with other libraries to further enhance your agent's capabilities. By the end of this session, you'll be equipped to navigate the SDK's full potential and adapt it to novel use cases.

## Mastering the API Reference

The API (Application Programming Interface) Reference is the definitive guide to every component of the OpenAI Agent SDK. It provides detailed information about classes, methods, functions, and their parameters. Learning to effectively use an API reference is a fundamental skill for any software developer.

### Key Sections to Look For in an API Reference:

1.  **Modules/Packages:** Top-level organization of the SDK (e.g., `agents`, `agents.tools`, `agents.exceptions`).
2.  **Classes:** Detailed descriptions of core objects (e.g., `Agent`, `Runner`, `ModelSettings`, `SQLiteSession`).
    *   **Constructor:** How to create an instance of the class, including all parameters.
    *   **Methods:** Functions associated with the class, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
    *   **Attributes:** Properties or data members of the class.
3.  **Functions:** Standalone functions (e.g., `function_tool`).
4.  **Enums/Constants:** Predefined values or configurations.
5.  **Examples:** Often, the best way to understand usage is through provided code examples.

### Tips for Navigating the API Reference:

*   **Start with the High-Level:** Begin with the main modules or core classes to get an overview.
*   **Search Functionality:** Most online API references have a search bar. Use it to quickly find specific classes or functions.
*   **Understand Parameters:** Pay close attention to parameter types, whether they are optional, and their default values.
*   **Read Docstrings/Descriptions:** These explain the purpose and behavior of each component.
*   **Look for Return Values:** Understand what a function or method will return.
*   **Check for Exceptions:** Be aware of any exceptions that a function might raise.

## Exploring Powerful Extensions and Integrations

The OpenAI Agent SDK provides a robust core, but its power can be significantly amplified by integrating with other libraries, frameworks, or services. These extensions allow your agents to tap into capabilities not natively provided by the SDK.

### Categories of Extensions:

1.  **External Tool Integrations:**
    *   **Databases:** Connect agents to SQL, NoSQL, or graph databases (e.g., `SQLAlchemy`, `MongoDB`, `Neo4j` drivers) to store and retrieve structured data.
    *   **APIs:** Integrate with virtually any external service (e.g., CRM, ERP, payment gateways, social media APIs) using `requests` or dedicated client libraries.
    *   **Cloud Services:** Leverage cloud-specific services like object storage (S3, GCS), message queues (SQS, Pub/Sub), or serverless functions.

2.  **Advanced Memory Solutions:**
    *   **Vector Databases:** Integrate with production-grade vector stores (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, ChromaDB) for scalable RAG implementations (Day 29).
    *   **Knowledge Graphs:** Use graph databases to store complex relationships and enable sophisticated reasoning.

3.  **Speech Technologies:**
    *   **STT/TTS Libraries:** Integrate with high-quality Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services (e.g., OpenAI Whisper/TTS API, Google Cloud Speech, AWS Polly/Transcribe) for voice agents (Day 37).

4.  **Observability and Monitoring:**
    *   **Tracing Platforms:** Connect to dedicated AI observability platforms (e.g., LangSmith, Weights & Biases, custom OpenTelemetry setups) for advanced visualization and analytics (Day 34).
    *   **Logging Frameworks:** Integrate with standard logging libraries (e.g., `logging` module, `Loguru`) and log management systems.

5.  **UI Frameworks:**
    *   **Web Frameworks:** Build interactive web interfaces for your agents using frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, Django, React, or Vue.js.
    *   **Desktop/Mobile Frameworks:** For native applications.

6.  **Specialized AI Libraries:**
    *   **NLP Libraries:** For advanced text processing, sentiment analysis, entity recognition (e.g., `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `Hugging Face Transformers`).
    *   **Computer Vision Libraries:** If your agent needs to process images or video (e.g., `OpenCV`, `Pillow`).

## Example: Conceptual Integration with an External Database Tool

Let's imagine extending our agent with a tool that interacts with a simple database to store and retrieve user preferences. This would involve using a database library like `sqlite3` (built-in Python) or `SQLAlchemy`.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.tools import function_tool
import os
import sqlite3 # Python's built-in SQLite library

# Ensure API key is set
if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    print("Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")
    exit()

# Database Setup (Conceptual)
# ---
DB_NAME = "user_preferences.db"

def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_NAME)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS preferences (user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, preference TEXT)")
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Database '{DB_NAME}' initialized.")

init_db()

@function_tool
def save_user_preference(user_id: str, preference: str) -> str:
    """Saves a user's preference to the database.

    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier for the user.
        preference: The preference to save.

    Returns:
        A confirmation message.
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_NAME)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO preferences (user_id, preference) VALUES (?, ?)", (user_id, preference))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return f"Preference '{preference}' saved for user {user_id}."

@function_tool
def get_user_preference(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves a user's preference from the database.

    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier for the user.

    Returns:
        The user's preference, or a message if not found.
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_NAME)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT preference FROM preferences WHERE user_id = ?", (user_id,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    if result:
        return f"User {user_id}'s preference is: {result[0]}"
    return f"No preference found for user {user_id}."

# Define an agent that can use these database tools
db_agent = Agent(
    name="PreferenceManager",
    instructions=(
        "You are a preference manager. "
        "You can save and retrieve user preferences using the provided tools. "
        "Always ask for the user's ID when saving or retrieving preferences."
    ),
    tools=[save_user_preference, get_user_preference]
)

print("--- Testing Database Integration ---")

# Simulate saving a preference
query1 = "My user ID is user_A. I prefer dark mode."
print(f"\nUser: {query1}")
result1 = Runner.run_sync(db_agent, query1)
print(f"Agent: {result1.final_output}")

# Simulate retrieving a preference
query2 = "What is user_A's preference?"
print(f"\nUser: {query2}")
result2 = Runner.run_sync(db_agent, query2)
print(f"Agent: {result2.final_output}")

# Simulate retrieving a non-existent preference
query3 = "What is user_B's preference?"
print(f"\nUser: {query3}")
result3 = Runner.run_sync(db_agent, query3)
print(f"Agent: {result3.final_output}")
