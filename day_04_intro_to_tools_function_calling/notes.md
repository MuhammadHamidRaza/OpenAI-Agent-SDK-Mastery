# Day 4: Intro to Tools & Function Calling

## Key Concepts:

- Understanding the limitations of LLMs alone.
- Why agents need tools to interact with the real world.
- Introduction to Function Calling: how LLMs select and invoke tools.

## Examples:

There are no specific code examples for this day, as the focus is on theoretical understanding of tools and function calling.

## Notes / Tips:

- Grasp the core idea that tools extend agent capabilities beyond text generation.
- Understand the conceptual flow of function calling.
- This day lays the groundwork for integrating actual tools in subsequent days.
