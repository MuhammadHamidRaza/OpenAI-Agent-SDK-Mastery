# Day 7 Notes

## Hosted Tools: Web & File Search

- This lesson explores the use of pre-packaged, or "hosted," tools.
- These tools provide access to external functionalities like web search and file system interaction without needing to write the integration code from scratch.
- The `WebSearchTool` allows an agent to access real-time information from the internet, overcoming the knowledge cut-off of the LLM.
- The `FileSearchTool` is a conceptual tool that represents how an agent might interact with a local file system (reading, writing, listing files).
- The Gemini examples use `google_web_search` and other built-in functions to achieve the same results.
