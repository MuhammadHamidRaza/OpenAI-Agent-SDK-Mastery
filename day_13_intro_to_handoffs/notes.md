# Day 13: Intro to Handoffs

## Key Concepts:

*   **Handoffs:** Structured transfer of responsibility and context between agents.
*   **Importance:** Enables specialization, modularity, scalability, robustness, and improved performance in multi-agent systems.
*   **Conceptual Flow:** How agents decide to hand off tasks and how context is transferred.

## Examples:

Refer to the `example/` directory for code examples demonstrating:
*   Simple handoff systems.
*   Advanced handoff systems with tools and sessions.
*   Conceptual support handoff systems.

## Notes / Tips:

*   Handoffs are crucial for building complex multi-agent workflows.
*   Ensure clear instructions for agents to facilitate proper handoffs.
*   Consider the context that needs to be transferred during a handoff.
